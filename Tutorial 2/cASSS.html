        <h1> Information about CLOUDS</h1>

        <p>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud">Wiki cloud page</a> <br>
            In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. 
            [1] Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals.
            

             On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature. They are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. 
             There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common.</p>

        <h1> Formation in the homosphere: How air becomes saturated </h1>

        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud#Formation_in_the_homosphere:_How_air_becomes_saturated"> Air Saturation </a> <br>

            Terrestrial clouds can be found throughout most of the homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Within these layers of the atmosphere, air can become saturated as a result of being cooled to its dew point or by having moisture added from an adjacent source.[12] 
            In the latter case, saturation occurs when the dew point is raised to the ambient air temperature.</p>

        <h1> Roll cloud </h1>
			

        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcus_cloud#Roll_cloud"> Roll Cloud </a> <br>

A roll cloud (Cloud Atlas name volutus) is a low, horizontal, tube-shaped, and relatively rare type of arcus cloud.
 They differ from shelf clouds by being completely detached from other cloud features. Roll clouds usually appear to be "rolling" about a horizontal axis. They are a solitary wave called a soliton, which is a wave that has a single crest and moves without changing speed or shape. One of the most famous frequent occurrences is the Morning Glory cloud in Queensland, Australia, which can occur up to four out of ten days in October.[2] One of the main causes of the Morning Glory cloud is the mesoscale circulation associated with sea breezes that develop over the Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria.
 However, similar features can be created by downdrafts from thunderstorms and are not exclusively associated with coastal regions.</p>
